      <h1 style="position: center;">Laundry 101 was conceived long before I ever knew it! During middle school in
the groovy 1970s my mother, Carol assigned me the chores of folding laundry
and ironing my father’s work shirts (she seemed delighted … I dreaded it).
Unexpectedly, I found calm in the rhythm of its repetition. Folding laundry
became my focused thinking time. Creating evenly sized units from a variety of
clothing, sheets and towels became my bailiwick. I am a draftsperson by trade,
so each pile of finished laundry is an opportunity for me to create perfect
geometric symmetry … a specimen of laundry to behold! It’s something I’m
curiously fond of doing.
You see, Carol was the quintessential, mid-century modern housewife whose
calling was in “Home Economics.” Taking good care of the home and the family
was her essence, her art, and she was revered because of it. Not only was her
work impressive, but she also made it look effortless. Family, friends,
entertaining, homemaking!
My dad, George was the breadwinner who assumed the ‘typical of the time’ male
responsibilities of yard work and maintaining the cars, while my mom was the
stitching that held the fabric of the rest of life together for our family.
I was able to breathe life into Laundry 101 because of Carol and George and
everything they instilled in me. They nurtured my creative nature, encouraged
believing in my instincts, promoted the art of listening to and learning from others,
taught me the value of treating people kindly, to try new things, and for heaven’s
sake … doing a damn good load of laundry!
I want you to step into Laundry 101 and leave with the same good feelings that
Carol gave everybody who came into our home way back when. Let us welcome
you to our boutique Laundromat with a friendly face and a warm smile, and send
you off with a freshly scented pile of laundry set in perfectly coiffed corners. You
won&#39;t find the typical white walled industrial ambiance here at Laundry 101. What
you will find is warmth, friendliness, cleanliness and a feel good place where
laundry is less a job, and more an art.
Meet Gigi … She is the Laundry 101 mascot, a kickass, expert laundress who
can resolve your toughest laundry challenges in a jiffy. Gigi always has the
answer. This photo of my mom, circa 1952, inspired her. And her sputnik-like
china pattern, “Evening Star” by Syracuse China inspired the logo and look for
my upcoming blog! It’s called “Gigi’s Spin”.
Thank you for being a loyal customer and for helping to build my business. I
hope you continue to find value in the service with a smile our fantastic team
provides. </h1>
